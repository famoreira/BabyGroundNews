Ground-News-Inspired Intelligence Pipeline
Python · APIs · Sentiment Analysis · LLM Summarization
This project demonstrates how to build a Ground News–style intelligence pipeline using Python, external APIs, lightweight NLP, and large language models (LLMs).
The goal is not just to summarize news, but to:
•	aggregate coverage across many outlets
•	surface political bias as metadata
•	weight stories by recency
•	analyze sentiment by perspective
•	produce structured, dashboard-ready insights
The same architectural pattern has been used in enterprise environments, including PySpark pipelines in Microsoft Fabric to summarize ServiceNow outages for Power BI ingestion.

What This Project Does
At a high level, the pipeline:
1.	Ingests news articles from a search API with topic, geography, and domain constraints
2.	Normalizes timestamps and applies recency decay weighting
3.	Classifies sources by political leaning and region
4.	Calculates sentiment using fast, explainable NLP methods
5.	Uses GPT-style LLMs to synthesize weekly summaries via a map–reduce pattern
6.	Outputs structured results suitable for dashboards and reports

This produces insights such as:
•	dominant narratives
•	underrepresented viewpoints (“blind spots”)
•	tone differences across political leanings
•	concise weekly intelligence briefs

Why This Matters
This project shows how to:
•	combine traditional data engineering with LLMs
•	treat bias, sentiment, and recency as first-class signals
•	keep LLM usage structured, deterministic, and auditable
•	scale the approach from notebooks to enterprise platforms
It’s not about replacing analytics — it’s about augmenting it with synthesis.

Tech Stack
•	Python
o	requests, pandas, datetime
•	News Search API
o	Domain-filtered, rate-limited ingestion
•	NLP
o	NLTK VADER sentiment analysis
o	Keyword-based fallback sentiment
•	LLMs
o	Azure OpenAI / GPT-style models
o	Strict JSON outputs
o	Map–reduce summarization pattern
•	Visualization / Consumption
o	HTML rendering (demo)
o	Power BI (enterprise use case)

Output Examples
The pipeline produces:
•	Weekly topic summaries
•	Key developments
•	Simple timelines
•	Open questions
•	Political leaning distributions
•	Sentiment by ideological bucket
•	“Blind spot” identification
All outputs are structured for direct BI ingestion.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
•	Python 3.9+
•	API access token for the news search provider
•	Azure OpenAI (or compatible GPT endpoint)
Install Dependencies
pip install pandas requests nltk rapidfuzz openai
Configure API Keys
Set your tokens in the script:
BRAVE_TOKEN = "YOUR_API_KEY"
openai_api_key = "YOUR_OPENAI_KEY"
Run the Pipeline
Execute the notebook or script end-to-end to:
•	ingest data
•	enrich it
•	summarize it
•	render insights

Notes on Responsible Use
•	Political leaning classifications are heuristics, not judgments
•	Sentiment scores are directional, not definitive
•	LLM outputs are constrained to provided context
•	The system avoids speculation by design
This is meant for decision support, not truth arbitration.

Future Enhancements
•	Spark-native version (Fabric / Databricks)
•	Topic clustering & trend detection
•	Multilingual ingestion
•	Streaming / near-real-time processing
•	Automated Power BI dataset refresh
